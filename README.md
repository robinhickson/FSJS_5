FSJS Project 5

Employee Directory with modal window and search functionality

Uses Fetch to get data from server, and then manipulates that data to provide a rendered directory with cards, each representing one employee.


Note: Phone number format follows the rubric, but not strictly the 'Instructions Note', because it makes no sense to format all mobile numbers as US cell numbers. Therefore format from database is preserved.
